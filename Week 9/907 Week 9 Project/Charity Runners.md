## Problem description

A program is required to process information for a charity on a 10k Fun Run - all the runner data is shown below. The names of the 5 runners should be stored in the program at the start by being assigned in a list.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Runner Name</th>
    <th>Runner Number</th>
    <th>Runner Time (mins)</th>
    <th>Money Raised</th>
  </tr>
<tr>
  <td>Abbie Stevenson</td>
  <td>2191</td>
  <td>49.18</td>
  <td>312.50</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Chris Morrison</td>
  <td>1789</td>
  <td>51.36</td>
  <td>240.75</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Zoe Nicols</td>
  <td>1046</td>
  <td>42.58</td>
  <td>210.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Olivia Rogers</td>
