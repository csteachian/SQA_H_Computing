# Week 1 Challenge Task

These challenges have been designed to recap your knowledge of N5 Computing Science Software Design and Development.
Choose from the following options:

1. Create a program which asks the user to enter 5 temperatures, then calculates and shows the average temperature rounded to 2 decimal places. You can choose to use 1D arrays or not for this challenge.

2. Create a program which creates a 1D array of 10 random numbers (from 1-100) and then uses a fixed loop to display them on the screen.

3. Create a program which asks the user to enter the name of 5 runners and the time they took to run 100 m. Store each name and time in two separate 1D arrays. Use a fixed loop to display the name and time of each runner from the 1D arrays.

4. Create a program which asks the user for their name and then generates six random lottery numbers (from 1-50), storing these numbers in a 1D array. Create a suitable output for this program which displays their lottery ticket.
