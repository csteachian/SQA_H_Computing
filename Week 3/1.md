# Week 2 - Project

Your client now wants you to create a program to create custom invoices to bill bands for the badges they order.

The invoice should show the band name, the text on the badge and the number of badges they ordered (any number acceptable).

The total amount due should be calculated by multiplying the number of badges by 0.25 (25p per badge) and then displayed on the screen.
