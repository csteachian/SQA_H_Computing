# Week 3 - Project
# MAKE: Show the skills you have learned
# --------------------------------------

# Your client now wants you to create a program to create custom invoices to bill bands for the badges they order.
# The invoice should show the band name, the text on the badge and the number of badges they ordered (any number acceptable).
# The total amount due should be calculated by multiplying the number of badges by 0.25 (25p per badge) and then displayed on the screen.

# Pseudocode

# The pseudocode for this challenge is:

# 1. Ask for and store band name
# 2. Ask for and store badge text
# 3. Ask for and store number of badges
# 4. Calculate total cost of badges
# 5. Display band name
# 6. Display badge text
# 7. Display number of badges
