# Week 4 Project

Your client is selling many more badges to touring bands than ever before. They now want to offer a 10% discount to bands that order more than 150 badges at one time. The starting price for each badge is 25p.

The task for this project is to:

- create a program that asks the user for the number of badges they want to order
- calculate the total price including any discount
- then display the total price on the screen.
