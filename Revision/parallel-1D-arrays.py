# Parallel 1D arrays

bookTitles = [ "" for index in range(50) ] # 50 string elements in this array

bookAuthor = [ "" for index in range(50) ] # 50 string elements in this array

bookPrice = [ 0.0 for index in range(50) ] # 50 floating point elements in this array

bookStock = [ 0 for index in range(50) ] # 50 integer elements in this array

# Parallel arrays should have the same number of elements in the range eg 50
