# AutoFeed Automatic Dog Food Dispenser!

AutoFeed has designed an automatic dog food dispenser.

The product is designed to help dog owners prevent overfeeding.

The food dispenser has five containers.

Each container holds a maximum of 200g of food.

The containers release this food, one after another, at regular intervals throughout the day.

AutoFeed wants an app to allow users to enter information about the size of their dog and the weight of food they will give them.

The app uses this data to show if the weight of food is suitable for the size of dog.
