(i)
There are two companies (Ver and TelTo) which have the same CEO salary. This is the highest CEO salary.

When Selop is used as a chosen input, step 2 would be incorrect because it would display only one of the company names (TelTo) when both should be displayed.
(ii)
Additional refinements should include writing all positions of the highest salary found to a 1D array, then using this in step 2.12 to display all companies which have the highest CEO salary.
