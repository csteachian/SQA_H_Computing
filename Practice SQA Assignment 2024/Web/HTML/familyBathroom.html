<h2>Family Bathroom</h2>
<section>
<img class = "bathroomimage" src = "..\Images\familyDesign.png">
<br>
<p>A well-planned family bathroom, usually the biggest in the house, can make or break the morning rush and/or bedtime routine. The best designs are loaded with storage, easy to clean, and perfect for sharing.</p>
<br> 
<p>As well as considering who will be using the bathroom now, it also pays to cast your mind forward at least 10 years in order to future-proof your choices, especially when it comes to permanent fixtures like sanitaryware. </p>
<br> 
<p>Family bathroom ideas might include a bath, easiest for scrubbing up babies and toddlers, but teenagers usually prefer the speed and convenience of a shower, while older family members may benefit from an easily accessible walk-in shower. A little forward planning could save you the pain of a premature remodel.</p>
