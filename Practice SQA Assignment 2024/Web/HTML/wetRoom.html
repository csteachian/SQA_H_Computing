<p>Wet rooms are an ideal option for shower ideas if you have a small space because they take away the need for a bulky shower enclosure and open up the room. Wet room ideas are easy to clean and with such a minimalist design you can reflect your personality onto the space and choose more bold patterns and colours.</p>
<br> 
<p>Wet rooms are particularly effective in small or awkward spaces where head height is limited or there are strange layouts. </p>
<br> 
<p>Multigenerational and inclusive bathrooms are designed to cater to all family members whether it’s young children, parents or grandparents. Wet rooms can help make a property much more accessible by removing ‘obstacles’ traditionally found in a bathroom, for example, stepping into a bath or avoiding the lip of a shower tray when entering the enclosure.</p>
