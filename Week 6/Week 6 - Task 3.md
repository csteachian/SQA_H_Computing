# Week 6 - Task 3

Look at the following code

```python:
name = []

firstname = input("Enter your first name:")
surname = input("Enter your surname:")
fullname = firstname + " " + surname
name.append(fullname)

print(name)

```

Investigate the code and then modify it so that it asks for and stores 3 full names in the name array. For example:

```
Enter your first name:alice
Enter your surname:adams
Enter your first name:ben
Enter your surname:brown
Enter your first name:carol
Enter your surname:codd
['alice adams','ben brown','carol codd']
```
