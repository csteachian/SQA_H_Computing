# Week 4 - Task 3

Look at the following code

```python:
luckynumber = int(input("Please enter your lucky number: "))

if luckynumber == 4:
    print("Amazing! It's mine too!")
else:
    print("I think you entered your unlucky number.")
```

Change the program so that it asks if the user likes coffee or not and then displays appropriate messages. For example:

```
Please tell me if you like coffee: yes
I'm glad you know how to espresso yourself.
```

```
Please tell me if you like coffee: no
What's Sumatra with you?
```
