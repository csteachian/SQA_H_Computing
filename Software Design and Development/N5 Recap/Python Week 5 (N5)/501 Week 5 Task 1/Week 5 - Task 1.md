# Week 5 - Task 1

Look at the following code

```python:
message = input("Please enter the message to display: ")

for index in range(0,10):
  print(message)
```

Do not run the code but try to predict answers to the following questions:

(a) How many times do you think the message will display?

(b) Do you think this is a FIXED loop or a CONDITIONAL loop?

Click [here](../predict.md) and add your answer to the `predict.md` file. Then click on the `Run` button to check if you are correct.

Remember to click on the `submit project` button in the top right of this Repl.
